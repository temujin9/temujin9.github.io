You may notice this new site lacks things that the old one had. That is intentional. Effective immediately, T9 Productions is closing its doors to public business.

This space may or may not become something more. Possible candidates include:
- New blogging platform, to replace [the Russian-owned one](https://temujin9.livejournal.com/)
- Software projects too absurd to sell, and too compelling to ignore
- Perpetual "under-construction" sign *(1997-style, baby)*
