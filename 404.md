You may notice this new site lacks things that the old one had. That is intentional. Effective immediately, T9 Productions is closing its doors to public business. *However, fear not!* You can visit [The Greenfield Guild](http://greenfieldguild.com) for all your software coding needs: same great Nate, now with a firm focus.

This space may or may not become something more. Possible candidates include:
- New blogging platform, to replace [the Russian-owned one](https://temujin9.livejournal.com/)
- Software projects too absurd to sell, and too compelling to ignore
- Perpetual "under-construction" sign *(1997-style, baby)*
